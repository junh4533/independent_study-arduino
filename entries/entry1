# Entry 1: Understanding basics of a circuit

## What is arduino?
Arduino is an open source platform that utilizes both a circuit board and software to build electronics. 
To put this into simplier terms, it allows us to program the board to control gadgets like 
LEDs, motors, sensors, and much more! 
Not only is it a great tool to create new projects, 
but also a useful tool for programmers to bridge the their knowledge gap between software and hardware. 

## Electricity

In order to build something cool with arduino, it is imperative to achieve a basic understanding of electricity.
As we all know, electricity is the flow of electrons. The 3 basic principles of electricity are voltage, current, and resistance. 
These variables can be measured 
* Voltage, also known as potential difference, is difference in charge between 2 points (measured in volts)
* Current is the rate at which electricity flow (measured in amps)
* Resistance is the tendency to impede the flow of electricity (measured in ohms)

The relationship between the 3 variables are defined as such:
**I = V/R**, where **I** is current, **V** is voltage, and **R** is resistance.
As voltage increases and resistance decreases, the current increases. 
In order to deliver the most amount of electricity, 
both the current and the voltage has to be high while the resistance remains low.

### The digital ports

### Ground port
Have you ever wondered why pigeons don't get electrocuted when they stand on the utility pole wires?
The reason why pigeons don't get electrocuted is because they aren't grounded. You get it? Pigeons aren't GROUNDed because they're up in the sky. HAHA. 
As aforementioned, voltage is the difference in charge between 2 points.
In this case, the 2 points are the pigeon and the wire. 
Since electricity flows from high voltage to low voltage, 
the electricity, in this situation, will not flow because 
the voltage is the same and there is no difference in charge. 
**Every circuit must be grounded in order for electricity to flow** 
This is an example of a complete circuit.
